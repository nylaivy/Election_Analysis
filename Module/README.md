# Election Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate won.
4. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election
- The candidates were:
    -  Charles Casper Stockham
    -  Diana Degette
    -  Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate results were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes  
    - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes
    - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes

## Challenge Overview
In this challenge I used Python to analyze election data by doing the following:
- Creating scripts that read, write, and store data from files and arrays
- Performing mathematical operations
- Using decision statements, logical operations, and repetition statements to run code more than once
- Produce screen outputs
- Using knowledge of variables, arrays, conditionals, and loops

## Challenge Summary
Overall this challenge went smoothly as a lot of my previous knowledge in learning to program using Java carried over into the knowledge needed using Python. I was not only able to determine summary statistics of a large dataset of election data using Python but also format/display these results in an appealing way.
