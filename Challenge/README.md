# Election Analysis

## Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate won.
4. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
5. Get the voter turnout for each county
6. Calculate the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
7. Determine the county with the highest turnout

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Results
The analysis of the election show that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election
- The candidates were:
    -  Charles Casper Stockham
    -  Diana DeGette
    -  Raymon Anthony Doane
- Diana DeGette won the election
- The candidate results were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes  
    - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes
    - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes
- The largest county turnout was Denver
- The county results were
     - Jefferson received 10.5% of the vote and 38,855 number of votes
     - Denver received 82.8% of the vote and 306,055 number of votes
     - Arapahoe received 6.7% of the vote and 24,801  number of votes

## Summary and Future Recommendations 
In summary, I used Python to analyze election data by doing the following:
- Creating scripts that read, write, and store data from files and arrays 
- Performing mathematical operations 
- Using decision statements, logical operations, and repetition statements to run code more than once 
- Producing screen outputs 
- Using knowledge of variables, arrays, conditionals, and loops

I was not only able to determine summary statistics of a large dataset of election data using Python but also format/display these results in an appealing way. In the future, the election commission can use this script for other elections by changing the directory path for the file being read into Python for the analysis and adjusting the indexes of the arrays accordingly when parsing through the information depending on the format.
